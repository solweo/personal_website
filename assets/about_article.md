## Diving into the IT

I am actively diving into the IT sphere. I am getting deeper and deeper into topics related to software development. I want to immerse myself in development, handling user requests, working with data, optimizing processes, organizing business logic and if possible taking part in creating application's UX/UI.

It's easy for me to study someone else's code, calm with legacy, which helps a lot when I learn Java. I quickly absorb new information through understanding and immediately try to apply it. I can find common language with people, which helps a lot in teamwork.

## Hobbies that help me as a developer

I am into industrial design and microelectronics. My passion for design allows me to always think about the form, idea and function of what I am developing, whereas the engineering of embedded systems, allows me always keep in mind the performance of the code and try to look for more beautiful approaches to system design.

In the past I was heavily involved in producing media content, through video editing, motion graphics and working with sound, which helped a lot with my skills in delivering information.

Around the same time I started doing graphic design, combining it with professional courses on the subject. Now always when I design interfaces I think about basics of UX/UI
